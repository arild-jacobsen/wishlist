# API Reference

All endpoints require authentication (valid JWT session cookie) unless noted.
Unauthenticated requests receive `401 Unauthorized`.

The API is consumed by the app's own Client Components — it is not a public API.

---

## Authentication

### `POST /api/auth/request-otp`

Triggers an OTP code to be sent to the given email. Always returns `{ ok: true }`
regardless of whether the email is on the whitelist (to avoid leaking which
emails are valid).

**Does not require authentication.**

**Request body:**
```json
{ "email": "user@example.com" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "ok": true }
```

---

### `GET /api/auth/[...nextauth]`
### `POST /api/auth/[...nextauth]`

NextAuth's internal endpoints. Handles session cookies, CSRF, and sign-out.
These are consumed by NextAuth's client library — do not call them directly.

---

## Users

### `GET /api/users`

Returns all registered users with their wish counts.

**Response:**
```json
[
  { "id": 1, "email": "jacobsen.arild@gmail.com", "wishCount": 3 },

]
```

---

### `GET /api/users/[id]/wishes`

Returns all wishes for a specific user, with claim information attached.

wish owner, `claims` will be `null` on each wish.

**Response:**

    "user_id": 2,
